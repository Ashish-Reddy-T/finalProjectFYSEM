# The Line: A Border Journey

## Project Overview

*The Line: A Border Journey* is a text-based narrative game inspired by Francisco Cant√∫'s memoir "The Line Becomes a River." This game explores the human stories, moral complexities, and harsh realities faced by those who cross the US-Mexico border and those who patrol it.

This immersive experience invites players to engage with the border not as an abstract political concept, but as a complex human reality that transforms all who encounter it. Through authentic mechanics and narrative choices, players witness firsthand the physical, emotional, and moral dimensions of border experiences.

This project is created as part of NYU's FY-SEM course taught by Prof. Huddleston, as a creative project to explore and interpret Cant√∫'s powerful book.
