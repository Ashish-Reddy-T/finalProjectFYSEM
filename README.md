# The Line: A Border Journey

## Project Overview

*The Line: A Border Journey* is a text-based narrative game inspired by Francisco Cant√∫'s memoir "The Line Becomes a River." This game explores the human stories, moral complexities, and harsh realities faced by those who cross the US-Mexico border and those who patrol it.

This project is created as part of NYU's FY-SEM course taught by Prof. Huddleston, as a creative project to Cant√∫'s powerful book.
